# GL_Graphics_Programming
I used to teach a few modules on graphics programming at degree and masters level. Instead of having all that knowledge disappearing and not being available anymore as I no longer teach I thought that it should be put up here so that anyone who stumbles across it can read through the material and get to see some pretty pictures too.
